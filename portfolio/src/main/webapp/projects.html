            <p> Menu translator <br /> With Python, I and three other people worked together during ShellHacks(Hackathon) that would allow for an image to be to be read in and translated to any language. We created a GUI that would allow the user to select the language to translate to and image to be translated. This is very helpful with menus and/or instructions that are in a language the user does not understand </p>
