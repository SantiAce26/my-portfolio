        <strong>Project 1</strong>
        <div class = "bubble--highlight">
            <p> Menu translator <br /> With Python, I and three other people worked together during ShellHacks(Hackathon) that would allow for an image to be to be read in and translated to any language. We created a GUI that would allow the user to select the language to translate to and image to be translated. This is very helpful with menus and/or instructions that are in a language the user does not understand </p>

        <div class = "bubble--highlight">
            <p>Project Beats <br /> With javascript, html, css and python, I and three of my friends created a website from scratch. We also implemented Magenta API, an API that allows us to to create our own music through machine learning networks that have been established. With the Magenta API we created a website that showcased who we are and showcased the music that was created through the api.</p>

        <strong>Project 3</strong>
        <div class = "bubble--highlight">
            <p>Project Jerry <br /> Personal project that implements arduino and python to create an RGB audio reactive lamp. With an arduino wifi module I connected the strips of LEDS to a python script the continuously updates the strips based on the frequency of the audio being listened to. The script allows for different light options (i.e. pulse, energy, free flow, spectrum). The future plans for this lamp is to add voice commands and more functionality and move it to a smaller compact place. </p>
